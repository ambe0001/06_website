      <p class="mytext">Our toothpaste should be a natural product that can be easily purchased without a prescription. With help from various r esearchers, doctors, dentists, and coaches from KP, KU, and DTU, as well as programs such as Copenhagen Health Innovators, we began to explore the market for potential natural ingredients and examined the feasibility and effectiveness of absorption through the oral mucosa during the approximately two minutes of tooth brushing. Our intention is to test the effects of these different ingredients, including in combination with each other. We aim for the toothpaste to provide an immediate effect for the consumer, which aligns with absorption through the oral mucosa into the bloodstream.</p>
